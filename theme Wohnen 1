Act as a professional German language tutor for B2 level students. I want to improve my German vocabulary and grammar regarding the topic "Wohnen in Deutschland" (Living in Germany).

Please generate a detailed response that includes specific sentences and short paragraphs covering the following three sub-topics:

1. Types of Housing: Compare living in a shared apartment (WG), renting an apartment (Miete), and home ownership (Eigentum).
2. Finding & Signing: Describe the process of searching for an apartment (Wohnungssuche), visiting it (Besichtigung), and signing the lease (Mietvertrag).
3. Community & Rules: Explain the relationship with neighbors and the importance of specific house rules (Hausordnung, Ruhezeiten, Mülltrennung).

Requirements for the output:
- Level: B2 (Please use complex sentence structures like Relativsätze, Passiv, and Konnektoren such as "obwohl", "indem", "während").
- Format: Provide the German text first, followed immediately by an Arabic translation for each section.
- Key Vocabulary: After the text, list 10 advanced nouns/verbs used (e.g., die Kaution, die Nebenkosten, kündigen) with their Arabic meanings.
- Cultural Note: Briefly mention a unique German cultural aspect regarding housing rules (e.g., Kehrwoche or Ruhezeit on Sundays).
